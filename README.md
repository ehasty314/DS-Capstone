# Florida Population and Land Use Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Florida's population, land use, and elevation data. The project aims to understand the spatial distribution of population and land use types, and to assess the impact of potential sea-level rise on these factors.

## Project Overview

The analysis involves several key steps:

### Data Loading and Cleaning
- **Sources**: Included above in the Data/Raw_Data folder.
- **Processing**: Data are loaded into pandas and geopandas DataFrames.
- **Cleaning**: Renaming columns, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.

### Data Merging and Transformation
- **Merging**: Land use data is combined with population data.
- **Calculations**: Future population projections for 2150 and adjustments for potential sea-level rise.

### Data Visualization
- **Mapping**: Creation of color-coded maps using matplotlib.
- **Graphical Representation**: Plots to visually summarize data distributions.

### Risk Scoring and Analysis
- **Scoring System**: Development of a scoring system based on urban and built-up land use.
- **Integration with Income Data**: Adding income data to analyze socio-economic factors.

### Exporting Processed Data
- Data is exported for further analysis or sharing.

## Features
- **Holistic Analysis**: Covers demographic, topographic, and economic factors.
- **Future Projections**: Includes long-term trends and risks assessment.
- **Spatial Analysis Focus**: Emphasis on understanding geographic patterns.

## Enhancements
- **Interactive Visualizations**: (Future work) To extend the data to new coastal areas, to allow new states to understand their risks.
- **Advanced Statistical Analysis**: (Potential) For deeper insights.
- **Documentation**: Ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
