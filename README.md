# DS-Capstone
This project is a research project that will attempt to predict and visualize the coastline of a specific region of interest, over a specific interval of time, with intent to extrapolate out to any region and any time. The project idea comes from Mathworks real world problem sets. The hope is to solve the real world problem during the course of this capstone.

The group is comprised of Emmitt Hasty, and Kenny Phan.

The planned steps are as follows:
Identify a coastal region of interest and find corresponding coastline and 3-D elevation data for the region. Find elevation data that is 10 meters or better resolution. Data sources vary for country and region; for example, a good source of elevation data for the United States is the USGS National Map.
Develop a MATLAB function using Mapping Toolbox to import the map data and produce a new coastline definition given a change in sea level. Visualize the changing coastline on a map.
Find a climate data server to obtain predicted sea levels for the coastal region. Climate data servers provide various data sets generated from climate models. A couple of climate data servers to consider include NOAA Digital Coast and Copernicus Climate Data Store. See Visualizations of Northern Hemisphere Sea Ice Concentration for an example illustrating how to obtain and use data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store.
Write an example that uses the climate data serverâ€™s predicted sea level and uses the function developed above to visualize predicted future coastlines, such as for 100 years into the future.
