# Contribution

My contribution to the Florida Population and Land Use Analysis capstone project was to help find data and create interactive visualizations. I was also always in contact with my partner and communicated with him that if he ever needed anything he could let me know. 

The primary data that I found were the census data and land use/land cover data. The census data provided demographic data and the land use/landcover data provided environmental data about Florida's counties. In addition, I help find the elevation, sea level rise, income growth, and population growth data. This data was used to project what future changes might look like.

The interactive visualization that I created was the ArcGIS Dashboard: https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/a53ce4e6d8bd44ffb9456d407f720c1c. I took the CSV data from the model and visualized the results in ArcGIS Pro. In ArcGIS Pro, I was able to create risk score and risk level maps. Then I pushed the maps to ArcGIS's cloud service. This allowed me to connect my maps to the ArcGIS Dashboard program. ArcGIS Dashboard allowed me to create an interactive map that could be shared online for others to view. 

Inside the dashboard, multiple elements were inserted and configured based on CSV data. The elements inserted were the map, legend, list, chart, indicator, and category selector.  
- The map and the legend show the risk score and risk level for all the counties in Florida.
- The list allows the user to search and select any county in Florida to view.
- The chart displays the highest-risk counties.
- The indicator displays the median elevation of the entire state.
- The category selector allows the user to filter the data to display information for different time periods by decade.
